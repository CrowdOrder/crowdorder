Subject: Connection Confirmation


Hi (First Name),

This is just an email to confirm that we’ve just connected you to our Partner, (PARTNER COMPANY NAME), as you requested.

We’ll leave you to discuss your business requirements directly with them, but rest assured that you will now automatically receive a discount of (PARTNER DISCOUNT AMOUNT) should you decide to start working with (PARTNER COMPANY NAME).

Best of luck and thanks for your using Crowd Order!




Thanks,
The Crowd Order team
