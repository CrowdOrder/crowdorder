    <p>When building a business, it&rsquo;s so important to take your online presence seriously. When people want to find a service, where are they likely to go to find them? Google, of course. Google is pretty much a monopoly when it comes to search and any business worth their salt will want to ensure they are ranking for certain keywords that apply to their business. There is a ton you can do to help your business&rsquo; website rank well and this process is called Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).</p>
    <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
    <p>According to well respected blog <a style="color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo">Search Engine Land</a>, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the process of improving your site to increase its visibility for relevant searches. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.</p>
    <p>SEO is pivotal for any business strategy as there are literally trillions of searches every year, often with the intent to find a service or spend money. Customers use Google as their main source of information and it&rsquo;s critical that your business take as much of the search real estate as possible through products, services or informational content. Improving your visibility on search can have real impact on your bottom line and help your business thrive.</p>

        How can SEO help your business?</h2>
        <p>SEO is one of the best ways to get your business in front of customers and there a lot of benefits in investing in a robust SEO strategy.</p>
        <h3>Build Trust and Credibility</h3>
        <p>A business that can be seen on Google is more likely to gain trust than those with poor visibility. Credibility doesn&rsquo;t just come from the service you provide anymore. You need links from other sites, people sharing your content on social media and a decent amount of reviews of testimonials. The customer experience now starts online.</p>
        <h3>Better User/Customer Experience</h3>
        <p>The cleaner and easier to use your website is, the more likely users are going to trust your business and convert into leads or sales. This will not only help your users but will enable Google to crawl your site more effectively and rank your site for the target keywords.</p>
        <h3>Local SEO can bring highly targeted traffic and conversions</h3>
        <p>Location based searches such as cities or &lsquo;near me&rsquo; searches are highly prevalent now with the wide adoption of mobile. Targeting local keywords will likely bring better leads and sales than for the wider generic keywords that are highly competitive.</p>
        <h3>Target customers at all stages of buying funnel</h3>
        <p>Not all your potential customers will be ready to buy straight away. Through keyword research, you can identify the questions and information your potential customers might need, and you can provide those answers on your site via guide content or a blog post. Targeting people at this informational stage of the funnel is great for brand awareness and it makes it so much easier to gently push them into becoming a lead or bringing in a sale.</p>
        <h3>SEO can help you understand the market</h3>
        <p>The data available to you via SEO is invaluable. You can monitor trends as well as what areas are growing Month on Month and Year on Year. It can also help you identify your online competition and help you understand what your strategies should be to best them.</p>
        <h3>SEO can be cost-effective</h3>
        <p>SEO can be so much cheaper than other marketing channels if done correctly. With other channels such as PPC or Paid Social Media advertising you are constantly using up budget to get recurring business and it can often be unsustainable. With SEO, the level of traffic and conversion should be accumulative, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself getting steady leads and sales for years beyond the initial investment making it extremely cost effective when done right.</p>
        <h3>Long term Strategy</h3>
        <p>SEO is a long-term strategy and not a quick fix. Many business owners get frustrated when they don&rsquo;t get to page 1 for specific keywords within a month and if that&rsquo;s what you are after SEO is not for you. For startups and small businesses with newish websites, it can take months to see a real impact from your SEO efforts. If you have the patience to keep going with SEO, you will eventually reap the rewards where so many businesses fail to do so.</p>
        <h3>Easy to show progress</h3>
        <p>One of the advantages of SEO is that it&rsquo;s fairly easy to track progress and report on. You can see the amount of traffic and conversions you are receiving. You can see your best performing pages and products and what keywords you are ranking for. At the very least you will need to use and analytics software such as Google Analytics and also Google Search Console to ensure you can control what is shown on Google when it comes to your site.</p>
        <h3>Identify new opportunities</h3>
        <p>Using SEO tools can help you identify new keywords to target. This may open up new product or service lines that you hadn&rsquo;t thought of and even open up new territories that your business can operate in. Looking at seasonality and competitor data regularly can help you identify gaps and exploit them to your businesses advantage.</p>
        <h3>Inform wider marketing strategies</h3>
        <p>The beauty of SEO is that there is a plethora of data out there which can inform the business in other areas. If you know certain topics are in high demand in April, why not create an email marketing or social media campaign to capitalize on this? Google search data gives you a snapshot of what consumers are wanting to find information about or what services or products they are looking for. Use this data to inform your wider marketing and business strategies.</p>
